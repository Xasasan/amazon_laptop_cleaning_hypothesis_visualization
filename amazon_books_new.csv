(1827–1890)

Jyotirao Govindrao Phule was a pioneering social reformer, thinker, and writer who tirelessly fought against social injustices in 19th-century India. Born into a marginalized Mali (gardener) family in Pune, Maharashtra, Phule was acutely aware of the pervasive inequalities plaguing Indian society. Despite facing numerous obstacles, he pursued education and emerged as one of the era's most influential voices advocating for the upliftment of the oppressed.
Phule's relentless efforts to combat caste discrimination, gender inequality, and the exploitation of marginalized communities earned him the title of ""Mahatma"" among his followers. He, along with his wife Savitribai Phule—one of India's first female teachers—laid the foundations for women's education and empowerment by establishing schools exclusively for girls and ensuring that education was accessible to all, regardless of caste or gender.
Jyotirao Phule’s seminal works, such as Slavery (Gulamgiri), critique the entrenched social structures and call for radical changes to establish equality and justice. His writings expose the hypocrisies of the caste system and religious orthodoxy, advocating for an inclusive society where the dignity of all individuals is respected."
